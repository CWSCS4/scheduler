Scripts:

These programs are meant to simplify the process of scheduling.  Here is a list and description of each file:

spec.hsc:  This is the input file for translate.sh, which outputs to the configuration file spec.spc.
translate.sh:  Translates between the more human readable .hsc format and the less human readable .spc format.  This should be rerun whenever you tweak spec.hsc.
spec.spc:  Configuration file for schedule.exe and schedule.py (Hard-coded); generated by translate.sh.

schedule.exe:  Windows version of schedule.py.  Compiled from schedule.c
schedule.c:  Source code for schedule.exe
schedule.py:  This program executes most of the scheduling applications, except for the one that stores the final schedule.  For that, use store.py.  It uses as a configuration file spec.spc


store.py:  Stores the final schedule in the database.
